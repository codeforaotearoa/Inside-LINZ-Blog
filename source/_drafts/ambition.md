## Ambition

Ambition is an interesting topic.

If you think about it, a lot of the greatest feats in human history were the result of a person, or a group of people, who had a goal. It may have been something that was classed as within reach, but not easy, or just entirely overly ambition and not possible.

Of course, they don't have to be world changing by any standard. Anyone can do something ambitious, based on their own sense of scale.

The one constant I suppose is that it's not easy.

If being ambitious was easy, well, you wouldn't have a word for "it" now would you!

## How does it link to Code for Aotearoa?

Now! You might be wondering why you haven't heard a lot from us.

I suppose it kind of comes back to ambition in a way.

We want to work on something that will have a lasting impact of sorts. Perhaps not world changing but a small start that can enable others to pick up from where our work left of.

Of course, we're currently in a three month trial so we have to manage expectations but it's a better starting point than beginning from scratch, right?

Perhaps not the best analogy but you don't get elected mayor and then expected to restart the city from scratch. You work on it over time! (subtle / not subtle election reference)

## You said something just now but you didn't really... say anything?

Oh, yeah I think you have a point there.

I don't want to exactly state just yet what we're working on but I'll put it like this.

The struggle is that the most easily accessible, obvious "thing" to make would be some sort of web app that takes LINZ map data and displays "something"

and you know what? That would probably satisfy the criterea, right? We've have used openly available data, done and dusted.

But...

## But?

Well, that wouldn't really have any lasting impact would it?

Sure, it'd sit online for people to use but it'd just be a one off thing.

We're more interested in keeping the "open data" train chugging along at full speed and to do so, we want to work on some tools that would enable LINZ, and potentially other agencies to make it as easy as possible to open up their data sets for others as well.

## So what's the problem?

Well, like I was saying before, a web app would be obvious.

You can point to something like that, make it all shiny and attractive but a set of tools isn't exactly "sexy"
