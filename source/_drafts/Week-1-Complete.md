### Hey, you look kinda tired? Doing alright there?

Oh, me? Yeah, I've just had my brain overloaded with all the wonderous services provided by <a href="http://linz.govt.nz">Land Information New Zealand</a>

**__Title card drops from the ceiling__**

This is a blog post, not a TV show...

### Oops, wrong format, haha! So, I heard you've started off on this whole Code for Aotearoa business? What's the deal with that?

So! Before we talk about Code for Aotearoa, let's learn about Code for All.

### Ah, the ol' bait and switch?

Shush, this is my blog and I'll write it however I feel like!

*ahem*

Once upon a time, well, no actually instead of retreading old ground, I'll just refer you over to the [post](https://medium.com/code-for-aotearoa/why-code-for-aotearoa-a4c865ff7122#.vhjc5i5wp) that [Pete](http://twitter.com/peterjakey) wrote last week.

### Cheater

Well, it's more efficient I reckon. So, how about I tell you a little bit about LINZ then

### How about rather than you info dump on me, you just tell me a few cool things you learned

You're really good at this, you know? It's like you can almost read my mi-

Anyway, how do you feel about Hydrography?

### Hydrowhat?

Hydrography!

The study of water bodies, like lakes, rivers and even the ocean.

It's such a cool word, huh? Just kinda feels nice to say

### What's cool about water?

The temperature ;)

No but they do a lot of interesting stuff. They're responsible for mapping the sea. Without that information, you'd have people unaware of the depths and shallows which means a lot of beached ships.
