## Ambition

Ambition is an interesting topic.

If you think about it, anything notable that has every been accomplished was likely classed as ambitious as one point.

Some things were ambitious, and ultimately, doable while others were overly ambitious and failed but you can't blame them for trying, right?

Where would we be without the inspiration of millions of ideas that died but had a certain "something" to them. "Something" that either just wasn't right for the time or a good fit for the solution they seeked to solve.

Anyway, my point is that being ambitious isn't easy but it's better than nothing at all, right?

## What does this have to do with Code for Aotearoa?

So without sugar coating it, we basically want to make a set of tools, rather than a one off web app.

An app may be useful and shiny and marketable, more so than a set of tools but it's more, well, ambitious and hopefully longer lived.

It's not exactly tangable but it feels like people want, or expect, some kind of fancy interactive do-dad that they can fiddle with for hours on end which is great!

but...

### but?

Well, it doesn't really have a lasting impact! I've probably seen thousands of interactive sites that I've visited, bookmarked and never been to again.

What we want is something that will enable the release of more data, which isn't something likely to be attractive to your average citizen.

## Why not?

Suppose, for example, we were to help simplify the process of releasing data.

That's good and all but it also isn't very tangible. There might be a particular automated script or plugin that you can point to but it's not as easy to get citizens excited about that.

## In closing

Anyway, those were just some of my thoughts about what we've been thinking about.

It's pretty much also why we haven't had much to talk about since you can't really just post screenshots of some documents and call it a day.

We've also had the odd issue where almost every idea we come up with seems to already be in progress! Carving out your own niche is definitely hard work.

Anyway, we'll keep on being ambitious and trying to create something that will be useful, hopefully for a long period of time.
