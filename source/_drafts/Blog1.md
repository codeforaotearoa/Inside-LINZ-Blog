#The World Called LINZ
##LINZ
Land Information New Zealand or ToitÅ« Te Whenua, which is popular as LINZ, is an NZ federal government agency that is responsible for making regulations that govern our land.

LINZ is also the organtisation that has been the pioneer and is at the fore-front of open data.

## So who am I?
Well Hi to all readers, I am Vaishnavi - a software developer who along with my other developer friends - Marcus, Pete and Gabby, have joined a pilot program called Code For Aotearoa. We strongly believe that keyboard is mightier than a sword and we are here to change the world.
## So what is this Code for Aotearoa now?
Code for Aotearoa is a pilot to open new ways to have meaningful contributions into government. 

##8th September 2016... the day my world collided with these two other dimensions - CODE for Aotearoa and LINZ...
The first week at LINz went by really quick... Had an opportunity to meet lot of amazing people with a wealth of knowledge in their kitties, meeting them aside of LINZ wouldn't have been east let aloine get an insight into their work.

Some of them welcomed us...
Some of them supported us...
and some of them... well lets just say world has different types of people and each encounter with another Homo Sapien is a learning experience ;)

With so many meetings done and a lot of information at hand, me and Marcus have a daunting task of assimilating the information and then start the phase two of interviews...

As for LINZ, I can say that they have done a great job of releasing heaps of data, made it challenging for us to add value to it.
However, need to solve a problem and competition is what drives innovation and for LINZ being public sector doesn't help its cause. But all I can say is competeing with ones own self and trying to solve the pain point of their immediate customers would definetly be a good start.

Until next week its Vai signing off...
