#CHANGE

##What is change?...
To me anything different is change. 

This brings us to the next question…

###Do I like it?...
At the first instinct, I don’t like it… (here I don't include clothes and food coz I like those changes)

###So do I like it afterwards?... 
Well this depends on the change itself. If I can adapt to it quickly then yes I like it but if I have to make an effort then it takes a while to like it and even after that sometimes I don't like it.

###So why do I not like it?... 
That is simple because I think it is not good for me.. If I feel it is good then I like it but I feel otherwise I don't like it.

Wooh that’s a lot of liking in this blog….

###Hmm well lot of liking is better than disliking rt????????

That's the whole point.. If we get it and start liking stuff then things will be better

###And how does it relate to you work at LINZ?
You always have to break my bubble rt…. :/
Well it has all the relation to it and not just to LINZ but to every organisation.
And more so for organisations that have people working with them for a long long time.

A motivation to change in business is competition. If you don't cope up with it then somewhere deep down you know that it's going to fail sooner or later.

###So what is different in Government?...  
Well nothing much except the fact that you don’t have any competition and that you have people who have been working their for ages and are used to things being it “their” way that they don’t want to change anymore.

###So what happens to people who like change in government?... 
Some people stay there and keep pushing however, many of them, after a lot of pushing around here and there and not getting things done, eventually leave. 
So the result is a filtered accumulation of people who don’t want to change.

###So what do you think can be done to change the situation?... 
Hmm that's a good question… but the answer is straightforward. I think the day everything starts linking back to PERFORMANCE, this problem will be solved automatically.
Just the way private sector needs to keep up with change to sustain, similarly government needs to keep up with change to sustain and individuals needs to understand as well.

###So, you just are just validating what Darwin said years ago?.... 
Yep,  I am just confirming what we  all have known for years. 
If we understand this and make small changes at a time, we will be winners but if we oppose it and then have to change a whole lot of things that have piled up in front of us then we are just making our lives more difficult.

And that’s where I sign off today… more on performance next week :)
